                "I've had the pleasure to get acquainted with Gregory during an assignment
                for BNPP group. I liked his thorougnness and the efficiency he's got to 
                design and develop. 
                As a Lead developer and technical referee of the team, he has been essential
                to build this solution which was particularly complex and restrictive (security limitations,
                add strong ciphering capabilities in a web environment).
                He was also confortable with Agile methodologies, and luckily he has been
                able to take over and play the role of scrum master when came a need
                to compensate the shortcomings of the customer in this matter."

                "I joined Gregory as a team member in a sensitive BNPP project.
                What struck me immediately was his perfect mastery of the subject as well as his strong 
                commitment in its success ahead. Gregory has all the necessary required knowledge in IT, 
                concerning front as well as back end oriented technologies, and he can reply to the most 
                complex needs of his customer. It has been his assignments to integrate new components and 
                procedures in our framework and he did that, remarkably adapting to this aspect.
                Gregory has also a great deal of sense of humor yet maintains himself always professionel. 
                He has the capacity to lead and plan discussions to guide everyone in the team, and at the 
                same time he can step aside from time to time. I'll always be happy to work with Gregory."

                sustainable and flexible solution for the future."

                As a project manager, Gregory is best at project planning and risk management. After his first analysis and documentation, his staffs really have a clear direction to go. Projects under his management, therefore, are always delivered in time and in budget. 
                Being his colleage for more than 1 year, I also learn many good things from Gregory Anne, both in technical issues and management issues."
