            <br/>My assignment was to develop a software the purpose of which was to help
            the pre-handling (control, archiving, ciphering) of files of the General Inpection
            division of BNPP, and the upload toward a document management system. As a member
            of the developers Agile team, I provided all the solutions and I organized the 
            software architecture, thus I was the referent on most of the technical subjects.
            I also welcomed and trained the new developers and I maintained our test environments.

            <br/>
            <br/>
            Aptea is a French IT Outsourcing company specializing in software for business that is particularly sensitive 
            and complex (Energy and Transport). Since I have started with Aptea I have been involved in the guiding and 
            development of fix-price projects.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I was assigned to one customer only (public official establishment) and I carried out a 1800 MD project. 
            The purpose was to refactor wholly a 10 years old software which remained operative yet was based on an 
            outdated set of technologies and also needed to be opened to new stakeholders of the domain. I was a business 
            analyst first, though I also became a technical leader when the project got greater significance. On a second 
            project (started in 03/2014, for another public official establishment) I was fully responsible for the project
            time and budget, tasks organization and risk management. I led the team and managed all the customer interface.
            
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I guided the business analysis and wrote the SRS.
            <br/>
            I designed the architecture and integrated components, (digital signature using Keynectis' solution, Esri cartography API).
            <br/>
            I developed whole parts of the software, including the totality of the model layer of the software and the migration scripts.
            <br/>
            I managed and trained the software developers.
            <br/>
            I managed the customer interface and integrated change requests.
            <br/>
            I set the test environment (prepare test machines) for a software validation squad.
            
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Later, I took part during 6 months to an important project of Natixis Assurances as a member of the 
            Design Authority. I was charged to contribute in the technical debt rattrapage.
            <br/>I also worked 2 months for Safran Morpho and realised a JMS bridge to adapt a product to the
            technical context of a customer.

                <li> Pre-paid Top-up Systems for mobile phone suppliers: I achieved several upgrades
                    on the main customer's running system. </li> 
                <li> Gift Cards, Loyalty Cards and management systems: I promoted and sold the system
                    to prospects, also enhanced functionalities</li> 
                <li> Electronic Cash Registers: I created a middleware software to interact between
                    the terminal connected via RS232 and any retail management application. I specified 
                    the packets sent via serial between the ECR and the terminal, adapted for Softpay. I implemented
                    the exhange of these messages in Java using Javacomm API. Finally I provided a
                    standardized access to this middleware application using <big>CORBA</big>. Then I coached 
                    the team in the partner company (<a href="http://www.evietsoft.net/GCMS.aspx">evietsoft</a>), 
                    helped them to create the CORBA client able to use our middleware application. </li>
                <li> iPay: an online payment functionality for Gift Cards System (which I entirely designed)</li> 
                <li> VIP Service: I created an add-on to iPay to identify members using QR codes and

                </li>
                <li> PrepaidWebServices: I created a JAX-WS application to let customer accounts download transactions and cards
                    reports in XML format.
 
                </li>
                <li> Bill Collectors: I specified an add-on for Gift cards system and iPay, the aim of
                    which is to provide the card holders the possibility to pay their bills using our prepaid accounts.
                </li>
                <li> Lines Encryption System between Point-Of-Sales and banking application servers:

                <li> NFC Payment System &amp; devices: using Proximity Coupling Device,
