                "Gregory never feels satisfied with the current working process and technology of the company. He keeps seeking restlessly for improvements and his efforts usually remains in much more productive ways of working things out. 
                As a project manager, Gregory is best at project planning and risk management. After his first analysis and documentation, his staffs really have a clear direction to go. Projects under his management, therefore, are always delivered in time and in budget. 
                Being his colleage for more than 1 year, I also learn many good things from Gregory Anne, both in technical issues and management issues."

                "I knew Gregory Anne as a student in university of Joseph Fourier, 
                during this period I came to notice his human qualities as well as his high 
                involvement in the projects in which we have worked together. He later on accomplished 
                very high achievements in his scolarity which for me was the logical rewards to all 
                his work. I, therefore, highly recommend Gregory Anne for both his personal and 
                professional aptitudes." --November 25, 2009
