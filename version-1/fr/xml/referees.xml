                Gregory always showed high motivation on the project and proved to be very Agile 
                during the development phase. What I really appreciated is that he did not only 
                took into consideration the business requirements, but also aimed at building a technically 
                sustainable and flexible solution for the future."

                "Gregory never feels satisfied with the current working process and technology of the company. He keeps seeking restlessly for improvements and his efforts usually remains in much more productive ways of working things out. 
                As a project manager, Gregory is best at project planning and risk management. After his first analysis and documentation, his staffs really have a clear direction to go. Projects under his management, therefore, are always delivered in time and in budget. 
                Being his colleage for more than 1 year, I also learn many good things from Gregory Anne, both in technical issues and management issues."
