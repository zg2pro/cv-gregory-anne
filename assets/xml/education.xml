            As  is common in France, I had chosen to study the second year of my major at a different institute,
            as courses are compatible between different universities.
            I studied Software Engineering major in my 2nd year of masters the purpose of which
            is to prepare students for the job market. The courses provided us the access to any
            part of an SDLC (we were trained to manage projects, specify, design, implement, and control the quality).

            Each year my courses became more and more oriented in the domain I chose
            and from this year onwards I have only been studying really modern techologies. We had projects to
            analyse in a case study and then to develop.

            I got reoriented from a Mathematics Degree and so,
            to be able to carry out computer science projects I had to learn a lot by myself,
            mostly about the web and the operating systems. Meanwhile, when I had a course on object oriented programming concepts,
            I could learn the use of graphical libraries and added a very personal touch to a project.

            I was  part of an Engineering School whose  major is to develop Mathematics Research
            using Computer Science Tools. So we  learnt both Mathematics (with algebra, analysis, optimization, probabilities)
            and Computer Science.
